This repository contains the code used to acquire the dataset used in my thesis as well as the code used to construct sentiment portfolios and perform statistical analysis.

The dataset is available on request. In full, with the 1536-dimensional embedded articles, the data is approximately 15 GB, so it cannot be included in the GitHub repository.
